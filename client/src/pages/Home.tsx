// ─── FAQ Data ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    q: "Is MetFix a certificate?",
    a: "MetFix is an education platform, not a certification body. Our curriculum gives you the metabolic health knowledge and practical tools to transform your coaching practice. The Foundations Seminar and affiliate pathway represent the highest level of MetFix education, recognized by the MetFix community worldwide.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to complete the curriculum?",
    a: "The free What Is MetFix? class takes about an hour to complete. Specialty tracks range from 6 to 40 hours depending on the course. Foundations is a two-day in-person weekend seminar. You can move at your own pace with no deadlines.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between Essentials and Foundations?",
    a: "MetFix Essentials Advanced is the online curriculum and is required to apply for affiliation. It covers every mechanism, protocol, and coaching conversation you need to deliver metabolic health programming at a professional level. Foundations is the in-person, hands-on seminar and is strongly recommended for coaches and owners, but it can be completed after you become an affiliate. Most coaches complete Essentials first, then attend a Foundations Seminar to apply the knowledge alongside other coaches.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a medical background to take these courses?",
    a: "No medical background required. MetFix is designed for coaches, trainers, gym owners and doctors and healthcare workers who want to deliver clinical-level metabolic health knowledge in a coaching setting. Physicians and medical professionals are absolutely welcome and regularly attend Foundations. We have several medical professionals who run MetFix programs through their medical practices. For our medical professionals we also offer a dedicated Medical Nutrition Training track built for them.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a MetFix Affiliate?",
    a: "A MetFix Affiliate is a gym, box, or training facility that has been accepted into the MetFix affiliate program and committed to implementing MetFix programming in their community. Affiliates are part of a global network of coaches fighting chronic disease, with access to exclusive programming, community support, and ongoing education.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Broken Science Initiative?",
    a: "The Broken Science Initiative (BSI) is the research and intellectual foundation behind MetFix. BSI identifies where the science on chronic disease has gone wrong, and builds the evidence base for what actually works. BSI points to the problems. MetFix is how those solutions get applied in the real world, in your gym, with your community.",
